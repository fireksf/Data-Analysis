-- Creating New Schema: 
-- data cleaning mean: make the raw data, to Useable data. 
-- Removing Dupplicate file 
-- Formating: Standardizing the data, maybe date, country code, phone number or another data standard. 
-- Delate some data : Null and blank, un labled column and rows 
-- Always Remeber data is peice of information and sensative, take backup before any change. 
-- Remember SQL is case sensetive and some function are the same with like words: eg. date is the query and also function.
