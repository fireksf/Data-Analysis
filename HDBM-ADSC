1. General Data Analyst Workflow
A data analyst follows a structured workflow to solve business problems. Here’s a step-by-step approach:
Step 1: Understanding the Business Problem
Before touching the data, you need to understand the business context.
•	Who is the stakeholder? (Hospital management, doctors, finance team, etc.)
•	What problem are they facing? (Reducing patient wait times, improving resource allocation, increasing revenue, etc.)
•	Why does it matter? (To improve patient satisfaction, optimize costs, etc.)
Big Question
A hospital might ask:
"Why are some patients experiencing longer wait times than others?"
Step 2: Identifying the Right Data
•	What dataset(s) do you have?
•	What columns (features) are available? {PATIENT NO,	PATIENT NAME,	MOBILE NUMBER,	REGISTRATION DATE,	NATIONALITY,	DOB,	AGE,	DOCTORS}
•	Are there missing values or data quality issues? {Doctors_ID, Waiting_time,	Specialist}
Example: If you're analyzing wait times, relevant columns might be:
•	Patient ID
•	Doctor Assigned
•	Consultation Time
•	Department
Step 3: Cleaning and Preparing Data
•	Handle missing data
•	Fix inconsistencies
•	Standardize formats
•	Remove duplicates
Example:
If some patient records have missing consultation times, should you remove them or estimate them?
Step 4: Exploring the Data (EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis)
Use descriptive statistics & visualizations to find patterns, trends, and anomalies.
•	What is the average wait time?
•	Is there a pattern in peak hospital hours?
•	Does a particular department have higher wait times?
Use tools like:
•	SQL (aggregations, joins, filtering)
•	Excel (pivot tables, summary stats)
•	Power BI (visualizations)
Step 5: Generating Insights and Answering Business Questions
•	What are the key findings?
•	Are there correlations? (e.g., Longer wait times in certain departments?)
•	What are the actionable recommendations?
Step 6: Communicating Results
•	Create a Power BI Dashboard
•	Summarize key takeaways in a report
•	Use storytelling: “We found that wait times are highest in the cardiology department due to a shortage of available doctors.”
